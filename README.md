# 🍎 Food Analysis and Nutrition Chatbot API

<div align="center">

*🚀 AI-powered food analysis and personalized nutrition advice*

</div>

---

## 📖 Overview

This project provides a Flask-based API with two main functionalities:

1. **🔍 Food Product Analysis**: Extracts ingredients and nutritional information from food packaging images or barcodes. It then analyzes this data against a user's profile (allergies, diet, health conditions) to provide a "should consume" recommendation and a Nutri-Score.
2. **🤖 Nutrition Chatbot**: A conversational AI that acts as a nutrition expert, providing personalized food advice based on a user's profile.

The application leverages the Google Gemini API for image analysis and chat responses, Open Food Facts for barcode data, and a pre-trained XGBoost model for further analysis.

## ✨ Features

- 📸 **Image-based Food Analysis**: Upload a picture of a food product's packaging to extract ingredients and nutrition facts
- 🏷️ **Barcode Scanner Integration**: Fetch product data directly from the Open Food Facts database using a barcode
- 🎯 **Personalized Recommendations**: Get a "Yes/No" consumption recommendation based on your allergies, dietary restrictions (e.g., vegan), and health conditions
- 📊 **Nutri-Score Calculation**: Computes a Nutri-Score and grade for the product
- 💬 **AI-Powered Nutrition Chat**: Ask food-related questions and get personalized advice from an AI expert
- 🔄 **Fallback System**: If barcode data is unavailable, it falls back to analyzing the uploaded image

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- 🐍 Python 3.8+
- 📦 pip (Python package installer)

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### 1. 📂 Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LifeAtlas/life-atlas-food-analyzer-api.git
cd life-atlas-food-analyzer-api
```

### 2. 🏠 Create a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

#### 🍎 For macOS/Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 🪟 For Windows
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. 📦 Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **💡 Note:** If a requirements.txt file is not provided, you can install the packages manually:

```bash
pip install Flask Flask-Cors Pillow google-generativeai pandas joblib requests pyNutriScore scikit-learn xgboost
```

### 4. 🔑 Configure Environment Variables

The application requires an API key for the Google Gemini API. For local development, you need to set this as an environment variable.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your API key:

```env
GENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Do not commit this file to version control.

#### 🔐 To obtain a Google Gemini API key:

1. 🌐 Go to the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. 👤 Sign in with your Google account
3. 🔑 Click on "Get API key" and create a new key
4. 📋 Copy the key and paste it into your `.env` file for local testing

### 5. 🤖 Download the Machine Learning Model

The application uses a pre-trained XGBoost model (`food_consumption_model_xgb.pkl`). Make sure this file is present in the root directory of the project. If you have the model stored elsewhere, update the `model_path` variable in `app.py`.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application Locally

Once the setup is complete, you can start the Flask server on your local machine.

```bash
python app.py
```

🎉 The application will start on `http://0.0.0.0:5000`. The `debug=True` flag enables hot-reloading, so the server will restart automatically when you make changes to the code.

## ☁️ Deployment on Render

This project includes a `render.yaml` file, which allows for easy deployment to the Render cloud platform.

1. 🍴 Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. 🌐 Go to the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/) and create a new "Blueprint" service
3. 🔗 Connect the forked repository. Render will automatically detect and use the `render.yaml` file
4. 🔑 **Set the Environment Variable**: In the service settings on Render, add the `GENAI_API_KEY`:
   - **Key**: `GENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `Your_Actual_Gemini_API_Key`
5. 🚀 Render will build and deploy the application

## 🛠️ API Endpoints

The application exposes two powerful API endpoints.

### 1. 🔍 `/analyze` - Food Product Analysis

This endpoint analyzes a food product based on an image or barcode and a user's profile.

- **Method**: `POST`
- **Content-Type**: `multipart/form-data`

#### 📝 Request Form Data:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `image` | file | ❌ | An image file of the food product's packaging |
| `barcode` | string | ❌ | The barcode of the product |
| `profile` | string | ❌ | A JSON string representing the user's profile |

#### 👤 Example profile JSON:

```json
{
  "allergies": ["nuts", "soy"],
  "diet": "vegan",
  "conditions": ["high blood pressure"]
}
```

#### 🌐 Example curl Request:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -F "image=@/path/to/your/image.jpg" \
  -F 'profile={"allergies":["milk"],"diet":"none","conditions":[]}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:5000/analyze
```

#### ✅ Success Response (200 OK):

```json
{
    "analysis": {
        "ingredients": ["..."],
        "nutrition_facts": {
            "Calories": "...",
